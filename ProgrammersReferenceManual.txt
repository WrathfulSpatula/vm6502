1. Introduction.

	VM65 is a simulator which can be expanded to become an emulator of more
	complex computer system either a real one or completely abstract virtual
	machine.
	VM65 acronym stands for Virtual Machine 65 and is designed for MOS-6502
	simulation. In current form it allows to simulate a MOS-6502 CPU in
	MS Windows environment using MS-DOS command line UI.
	Software emulates all original MOS-6502 legal opcodes. The illegal opcodes
	are not emulated and are opened for expansion. It is up to programmer to
	implement illegal opcodes accurate emulation or replace them with extensions
	or traps. In current version they do nothing except to consume CPU cycles.
	The 6502 emulation is not purely abstract. The basic components of a real
	hardware CPU system are emulated: microprocessor, memory and memory mapped
	devices abstract layer  - about which more in section 4.
	Using this software user will be able to load plain text memory definition
	file, Intel HEX format file, raw binary image file or binary snapshot image
	created with this software and execute or debug code within it in
	a continuous or in step-by-step mode. 
	The file will be loaded and translated to the	emulated memory space and
	optional emulation parameters included in the	image will be interpreted and
	adequately translated into values of the corresponding internal flags. 
	It is possible to automatically run program starting at specified address,
	perform automatic reset	of the CPU after memory image upload or perform
	these actions from command line prompt of the debug console.

2. Command Line Interface and Debug Console.

	Usage:

        vm65 [-h] | [ramdeffile] [-b | -x] [-r]


	Where:

        ramdeffile    - RAM definition file name
        -b            - specify input format as binary
        -x            - specify input format as Intel HEX
        -r            - after loading, perform CPU RESET
        -h            - print this help screen


When ran with no arguments, program will load default memory
definition files: default.rom, default.ram and will enter the debug
console menu.
When ramdeffile argument is provided with no input format specified,
program will attempt to automatically detect input format and load the
memory definition from the file, set the flags and parameters depending
on the contents of the memory definition file and enter the corresponding
mode of operation as defined in that file.
If input format is specified (-b|-x), program will load memory from the
provided image file and enter the debug console menu.

	To start program, navigate to the program directory in MS-DOS prompt console
	and type:

	vm65

	Above will run the emulator. Since no memory image is specified, program
	will attempt to load dummy.rom and dummy.ram files, which supposed to be
	plain text memory image definition files. The simplest you can create can
	look like this:

	ORG
	$0000
	$00

	NOTE: To see the full usage help for vm65, use flag -h: 
				vm65 -h

	Program loaded with no arguments will present user with following UI
	which will be referred to as Debug Console:

	Each of the commands in Debug Console is interactive and can be used in two
	ways - user can issue command in the prompt, press enter and follow the
	instructions/prompts to enter remaining parameters OR if user already knows
	the format of the command, all parameters can be entered in a single line.
	To see full help for above commands, issue command H in the prompt and press
	ENTER.

	A quick overview of the some commands available in Debug Console:

	* Code execution and debugging commands.

	C - Continue

			Execute code from current address after it was interrupted.

	S - Step

			Executes single opcode at current address.

	A - Set address for next step

			Sets current address to one provided is argument (or prompts for one).

	G - Execute (continue) from address.

			Asks for (if not provided as argument) address and then executes code.

	N - Execute # of steps.

	X - Execute from address.

	F - Toggle registers animation.

	    When in multi-step debug mode (command: N), displaying registers
    	can be suppressed or, when animation mode is enabled - they will
    	be continuously displayed after each executed step.

	J - Set registers animation delay.

	    Sets the time added at the end of each execution step in multi
    	step mode (command: N). The default value is 250 ms. The change
    	of this parameter will basically set the speed of multi-step code
    	execution. Greater delay will slow down the execution but improve
    	readability of the registers in Debug Console as they will not change
    	as often as if this delay was smaller.

  R - Show registers.

  		Displays current status of CPU registers, flags and stack.

  O - Display op-codes history.

      Show the history of last executed op-codes/instructions, full with
    	disassembled mnemonic and argument.

  D - Disassemble code in memory.

      Attempt to disassemble code in specified address range and display
    	the results (print) on the screen in symbolic form.

  0 - Reset.

	    Run the processor initialization sequence, just like the real CPU
	    when its RTS signal is set to LOW and HIGH again. CPU will disable
	    interrupts, copy address from vector $FFFC to processors PC and will
	    start executing code. Programmer must put initialization routine
	    under address pointed by $FFFC vector, which will set the arithmetic
	    mode, initialize stack, I/O devices and enable IRQ if needed before
	    jumping to main loop. The reset routine disables trapping last RTS
	    opcode if stack is empty, so the VM will never return from opcodes
	    execution loop unless user interrupts with CTRL-C or CTRL-Break.

	* Memory access commands.

	M - Dump memory.

			Dumps contents of memory, hexadecimal and ASCII formats.

	W - Write memory.

			Writes provided values to memory starting at specified address.

	* I/O devices commands.

	I - Toggle char I/O emulation.

			Enables/disables basic character I/O emulation. When enabled, all writes
    	to the specified memory address also writes a character code to
    	to a virtual console. All reads from specified memory address
    	are interpreted as console character input.
    	The base address corresponds to blocking mode character I/O device,
    	while base address + 1 corresponds to non-blocking character I/O device.
    	The blocking device waits for the input character - code execution
    	stops until user enters the keystroke, while in non-blocking mode
    	the emulator takes the recently entered keystroke from the system
    	keyboard buffer. That means that implementing the character input
    	in 6502 assembly/machine code requires a loop reading from non-blocking
    	address until the character code is different than 0, while in blocking
    	mode it is enough to just read from I/O address. The emulator will only
    	proceed when the key was pressed by user.

    	Examples of 6502 code:

    	- a 'waiting' character input implemented using non-blocking char I/O

    		readchar: LDA $E001
    							BEQ readchar ; A = NULL, keep reading char I/O
    							RTS ; A = char code

			- a 'waiting' character inpute implemented using blocking char I/O

				readchar: LDA $E000
									RTS ; A = char code    							

  T - Show I/O console.

  		Displays/prints the contents of the virtual console screen.
    	Note that in run mode (commands X, G or C), virtual screen is
    	displayed automatically in real-time if I/O emulation is enabled.

  V - Toggle graphics emulation.

  		Enables/disables basic raster (pixel) based RGB graphics display
  		emulation.
    	When enabled, window with graphics screen will open and several
    	registers are available to control the device starting at provided
    	base address. Detailed description of the device registers os provided
    	later in this document.

	The difference between 'G' and 'X' is that code executed with command 'G'
	will return to Debug Console when BRK or last RTS (empty stack) opcode is
	encountered, while code executed with 'X' goes to full CPU emulation mode
	where BRK will invoke proper interrupt routine as setup by IRQ vector in
	memory. The last RTS opcode (empty stack) will return to Debug
	Console in both cases unless such behavior is disabled (and this is only
	true in case of Reset function, see command '0'). 
	Entering keyboard interrupt codes (CTRL-C, CTRL-BREAK) will return to Debug
	Console.

	NOTE: All addresses and memory values are to be entered in hexadecimal
				format.

3. Implementing the Virtual Machine.

	 The Virtual Machine (or Emulator) is implemented by the means of multiple
	 layers of abstraction. The higher the layer, the less code it contains
	 that is virtual hardware dependent.

	 On the highest level we have main.cpp which implements the UI and Debug
	 Console. Programmer can replace this code with custom designed UI or GUI.

	 The definition of the emulated system layer begins in VMachine class
	 (VMachine.h and VMachine.cpp) which provides the implementation of the
	 entire emulated system. It is a template upon which programmer can expand.
	 Several important methods are defined here that allow to execute the 6502
	 code in many different modes:

		Regs *Run();
		Regs *Run(unsigned short addr);
		Regs *Exec();
		Regs *Exec(unsigned short addr);		
		Regs *Step();
		Regs *Step(unsigned short addr);	 
		void Reset();

	 Programmer should use this class to implement all the pieces of the
	 emulated virtual computer system on the highest abstraction level.
	 In current version the VMachine class initializes the basic system with CPU
	 and memory at its core and character and raster graphics display devices.

	 Going one step down the abstraction layer are MKCPu and Memory classes.

	 The MKCpu class is the most important part of the emulator. It defines
	 the whole system's architecture. Based on the type of the CPU device we
	 know how to implement the rest of the core components by knowing the
	 maximum addressable memory space, size of the data bus (8-bit, 16-bit) etc.
	 The MKCpu class defines all the internal registers of the virtual CPU,
	 the op-codes interpreter and its interface to outside components.
	 The most important API methods are:

		Regs *ExecOpcode(unsigned short memaddr);
		Regs *GetRegs();
		void	SetRegs(Regs r);
		void Reset();																	// reset CPU		
		void Interrupt();															// Interrupt ReQuest (IRQ)

	 The Memory class (Memory.h and Memory.cpp) implements essential concept
	 in any microprocessor based system, which is the memory. The assumption is
	 that such a system requires some sort of program storage to be able to
	 execute code. This is not entirely true in the real world, where we can
	 make the CPU 'think' that it executes the real code with a tricky circuit
	 and get away without any memory to make the CPU run. This however has
	 limited usefulness (diagnostics, testing the basic operation of CPU) and
	 has no use in the emulation domain where we have no need to test the CPU
	 chip for basic operation on electrical level. The Memory class is also an
	 important entry level for another concept of microprocessor based system:
	 a memory mapped device. This brings us to the lower level of abstraction
	 which is the memory mapped device class: MemMapDev.

	 Class MemMapDev is a core or hub for implementing all the devices that are
	 connected to the virtual CPU via its memory address space. This is
	 explained in more detail in chapter 4.

	 All remaining classes are the implementation of the actual devices on the
	 lowest level of abstraction (from the emulator point of view) and other
	 helper classes and methods.
	 Examples of virtual devices emulation implementation are: Display and
	 GraphDisp.

	 Programmer can add more code and more classes and integrate them into the
	 emulator using this architecture. This is the starting point of the
	 emulator of a real microprocessor based system or completely abstract
	 virtual machine that has no hardware counterpart.

4. Memory Mapped Device Abstraction Layer/API.

	In microprocessor based systems in majority of cases communication with
	peripheral devices is done via registers which in turn are located under
	specific memory addresses.
	Programming API responsible for modeling this functionality is implemented
	in Memory and MemMapDev classes. The Memory class implements access to
	specific memory locations and maintains the memory image.
	The MemMapDev class implements specific device address spaces and handling
	methods that are triggered when addresses of the device are accessed by the
	microprocessor.
	Programmers can expand the functionality of this emulator by adding
	necessary	code emulating specific devices in MemMapDev and Memory classes
	implementation and header files. In current version, two basic devices are
	implemented:
	- character I/O and 
	- raster (pixel based) graphics display. 
	Character I/O device uses 2 memory locations, one for non-blocking I/O
	and one for blocking I/O. Writing to location causes character output, while
	reading from location waits for character input (blocking mode) or reads the
	character from keyboard buffer if available (non-blocking mode).
	The graphics display can be accessed by writing to multiple memory locations.

	If we assume that GRDEVBASE is the base address of the Graphics Device, there
	are following registers:

	Offset   Register               Description
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 0       GRAPHDEVREG_X_LO       Least significant part of pixel's X (column)
	                                coordinate or begin of line coord. (0-255)
	 1       GRAPHDEVREG_X_HI       Most significant part of pixel's X (column)
	                                coordinate or begin of line coord. (0-1)                                      
	 2       GRAPHDEVREG_Y          Pixel's Y (row) coordinate (0-199)
	 3       GRAPHDEVREG_PXCOL_R    Pixel's RGB color component - Red (0-255)
	 4       GRAPHDEVREG_PXCOL_G    Pixel's RGB color component - Green (0-255)
	 5       GRAPHDEVREG_PXCOL_B    Pixel's RGB color component - Blue (0-255)
	 6       GRAPHDEVREG_BGCOL_R    Backgr. RGB color component - Red (0-255)
	 7       GRAPHDEVREG_BGCOL_G    Backgr. RGB color component - Green (0-255)
	 8       GRAPHDEVREG_BGCOL_B    Backgr. RGB color component - Blue (0-255)
	 9       GRAPHDEVREG_CMD        Command code
	10       GRAPHDEVREG_X2_LO      Least significant part of end of line's X
	                                coordinate
	11       GRAPHDEVREG_X2_HI      Most significant part of end of line's X
	                                coordinate                                
	12       GRAPHDEVREG_Y2         End of line's Y (row) coordinate (0-199)

	Writing values to above memory locations when Graphics Device is enabled
	allows to set the corresponding parameters of the device, while writing to
	command register executes corresponding command (performs action) per codes
	listed below:

	Command code                    Command description
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	GRAPHDEVCMD_CLRSCR = 0          Clear screen
	GRAPHDEVCMD_SETPXL = 1          Set the pixel location to pixel color
	GRAPHDEVCMD_CLRPXL = 2          Clear the pixel location (set to bg color)
	GRAPHDEVCMD_SETBGC = 3          Set the background color
	GRAPHDEVCMD_SETFGC = 4          Set the foreground (pixel) color
	GRAPHDEVCMD_DRAWLN = 5          Draw line
	GRAPHDEVCMD_ERASLN = 6          Erase line

	Reading from registers has no effect (returns 0).

	Above method of interfacing GD requires no dedicated graphics memory space
	in VM's RAM. It is also simple to implement.
	The downside - slow performance (multiple memory writes to select/unselect 
	a pixel or set color).
	I plan to add graphics frame buffer in the VM's RAM address space in future
	release.

4.1. Adding new device implementation.

	MemMapDev.h and MemMapDev.cpp define the higher abstraction layer for memory
	mapped devices. Memory address range class: AddrRange and device class: 
	Device are implemented to provide core facilities and class: MemMapDev for
	future expansion of the emulated system.

	To add a new device to the memory mapped devices, programmer must:

	* Implement the device behavior in a separate class.
	
		See GraphDisp.h, GraphDisp.cpp as example.
		This is the actual device driver, code that defines how the device works.
		
		Device driver class may define the raster graphics display functions,
		a real time clock	chip functions, sound chip functions, Disk Drive
		functions etc.
		This code does not contain definitions related to how the device is mapped
		to the memory space of emulated computer system. That would be the
		responsibility of MemMapDev class, providing the middle layer of
		abstraction	for connecting the device to the memory space of the CPU.

	* Add necessary definitions, enumerators and methods to the MemMapDev.h
		and MemMapDev.cpp.
	
		The minimal set should include methods to initialize the device and
		methods executed when memory mapped device registers are read from and
		written to.
		Other methods may be needed to perform device implementation specific
		functions.
		See example set of methods for simple raster graphics device:

			unsigned short GetGraphDispAddrBase();
			void ActivateGraphDisp();
			void DeactivateGraphDisp();

			int GraphDispDevice_Read(int addr);
			void GraphDispDevice_Write(int addr, int val);

			void GraphDisp_ReadEvents();
			void GraphDisp_Update();

		Important concept at the core of the memory mapped device is the method
		handling the action to be performed when certain memory register is being
		read from or written to. These are defined as function pointers in Device
		class: read_fun_ptr and write_fun_ptr.

		struct Device {
			int             num;						// device number
			string          name;						// device name
			MemAddrRanges 	addr_ranges;		// vector of memory address ranges for
																			// this device
			ReadFunPtr			read_fun_ptr;		// pointer to memory register read
																			// function
			WriteFunPtr			write_fun_ptr;	// pointer to memory register write
																			// function
			DevParams				params;					// list of device parameters	

			[...]

		Programmer implements these handler methods inside MemMapDev class.

		Programmer should not forget to add the new device to the pool in the
		MemMapDev::Initialize() method which adds all implemented devices to the
		devices list with their corresponding default memory bases/ranges and
		parameters. These devices can be later re-defined with
		MemMapDev::SetupDevice() method.

		typedef vector<Device> MemMappedDevices;

		[...]

		MemMappedDevices mDevices;

		[...]

		void MemMapDev::Initialize()
		{

			[...]

			Device dev_grdisp(DEVNUM_GRDISP, 
										  "Graphics Display", 
										  addr_ranges_grdisp, 
										  &MemMapDev::GraphDispDevice_Read,
										  &MemMapDev::GraphDispDevice_Write,
										  dev_params_grdisp);
			mDevices.push_back(dev_grdisp);	

		[...]

	* Add necessary ports in Memory.h and Memory.cpp.

		Memory class already implements the code handling memory mapped devices
		in all read/write memory methods. Some local methods and flags specific
		to the devices may be needed for implementation convenience.

			Important relevant methods in Memory class:

			int AddDevice(int devnum);
			int DeleteDevice(int devnum);
			void SetupDevice(int devnum, MemAddrRanges memranges, DevParams params);

		are the API to be called from higher level abstraction layer. Some proxy
		methods can be implemented in Memory class for this purpose.
		See Memory::SetGraphDisp() and VMachine::SetGraphDisp() methods for
		an example. The SetGraphDisp() method in Memory class defines the memory
		mapped device on a lower level and calls SetupDevice().
